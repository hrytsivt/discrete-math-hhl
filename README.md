# discrete-math-hhl
Project 5. Discrete Math. Hayda, Hrytsiv, Lebyak.

Description:
This project is a program, which builds all lexicographic premutations with numbers in the given set.
The structure of set is {1, 2, 3,..., n}. n - is the last number, which should be entered by the user. 
As the result you could see your set itself and lists(organised in columns) with all permutations of your set in lexicographic order.

Instructions:
At first you'll see a short text how to use the program.
Then you have to enter the last number of a set range('n') and you'll get the result of the execution of this program.w
